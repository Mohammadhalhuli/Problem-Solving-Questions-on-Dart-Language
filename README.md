Problem B

B. Watermelon
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test64 megabytes
inputstandard input
outputstandard output
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 ≤ w ≤ 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Problem D

D. Bear and Big Brother
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
inputstandard input
outputstandard output
Bear Limak wants to become the largest of bears, or at least to become larger than his brother Bob.

Right now, Limak and Bob weigh a and b respectively. It's guaranteed that Limak's weight is smaller than or equal to his brother's weight.

Limak eats a lot and his weight is tripled after every year, while Bob's weight is doubled after every year.

After how many full years will Limak become strictly larger (strictly heavier) than Bob?

Input
The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) — the weight of Limak and the weight of Bob respectively.

Output
Print one integer, denoting the integer number of years after which Limak will become strictly larger than Bob.

Problem E

E. George and Accommodation
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
inputstandard input
outputstandard output
George has recently entered the BSUCP (Berland State University for Cool Programmers). George has a friend Alex who has also entered the university. Now they are moving into a dormitory.

George and Alex want to live in the same room. The dormitory has n rooms in total. At the moment the i-th room has pi people living in it and the room can accommodate qi people in total (pi ≤ qi). Your task is to count how many rooms has free place for both George and Alex.

Input
The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of rooms.

The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers pi and qi (0 ≤ pi ≤ qi ≤ 100) — the number of people who already live in the i-th room and the room's capacity.

Output
Print a single integer — the number of rooms where George and Alex can move in.

Problem H
H. Presents
time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes
inputstandard input
outputstandard output
Little Petya very much likes gifts. Recently he has received a new laptop as a New Year gift from his mother. He immediately decided to give it to somebody else as what can be more pleasant than giving somebody gifts. And on this occasion he organized a New Year party at his place and invited n his friends there.

If there's one thing Petya likes more that receiving gifts, that's watching others giving gifts to somebody else. Thus, he safely hid the laptop until the next New Year and made up his mind to watch his friends exchanging gifts while he does not participate in the process. He numbered all his friends with integers from 1 to n. Petya remembered that a friend number i gave a gift to a friend number pi. He also remembered that each of his friends received exactly one gift.

Now Petya wants to know for each friend i the number of a friend who has given him a gift.

Input
The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the quantity of friends Petya invited to the party. The second line contains n space-separated integers: the i-th number is pi — the number of a friend who gave a gift to friend number i. It is guaranteed that each friend received exactly one gift. It is possible that some friends do not share Petya's ideas of giving gifts to somebody else. Those friends gave the gifts to themselves.

Output
Print n space-separated integers: the i-th number should equal the number of the friend who gave a gift to friend number i.
